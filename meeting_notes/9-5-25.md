## Discussion
### DIY Scanner Project
- Raspberry pi set-up progress
	- Test with external monitor
	- Connect with SSH once it's booted to get it on the network
	- When Jeff has done this on his home network, just inputs internet password
	- Could try with a different SD card to see if that's the issue

- Getting things set-up on GitHub

## â€‹Action Items
