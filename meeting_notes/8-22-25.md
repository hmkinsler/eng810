## Discussion
- Text final / journal as working on the script
- Git hub repository & adding comments to code
- Look at different introductions to Python that aren't humanist centered -- something specific to software development or generic introductions to Python
- Involve Gene in the process more and get connected with faculty in electrical engineering or software development
- Part of the idea is to learn how to collaborate with other programmers and developers
## â€‹Action Items:
- Connect with instructors in the senior design program for electrical engineering -- Jeff Mielke can ask for recommendations 
- Explore options for cameras: DSLRs vs. Pi cameras
	- Need to get the software working on the machine connected to the cameras -- maybe just all off Rapsberry Pi
	- Or figure the DSLRs out
	- Or look at how Raspberry Pi cameras have been used as webcams on Windows
	- Review documentation online RE: working with multiple cameras
- Look for example projects whose code I want to emulate
- Setup github repository
- Begin writing notes
- Create sketches of components for the project, discuss the design, and narrow down what to pursue, basically need to give a sense of the entire goals & challenges for each component
	- Sketches with different scenarios -- what does it look like to bypass the Raspberry Pi cameras instead? What are the affordances and limitations? What benefits and limitations would come with those?
- Review Google Drive folders from previous senior design projects
