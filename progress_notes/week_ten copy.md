# Raspberry Pi
- I was able to successfully build and compile

# Experimenting w/ Arduino to control foot pedal
- Still need to draw up wire diagram
- Plan to revisit the [capture.py](/diyscanner/capture.py) script to use either buttons or foot pedal switches to determine which camera(s) are included in the main function block
- I haven't worked with the foot pedal yet, but I did manage to get something set up on a breadboard
