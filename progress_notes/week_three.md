# Rapsberry Pi installation
- I tried to use the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B with the CrowPi and found it wasn't a good fit-- Might be able to switch out the power cable adapter, but there was a Pi 4 B available, so shifted to that instead
- I think I frequently forget just how long it does take to boot up, but when I first got the CrowPi version of the Raspberry Pi Desktop image onto the Pi, installed it into the CrowPi case, and booted it, the red and green lights both indicated that the SD and power supply were working well-- I just was getting a blue "no signal" screen on the CrowPi for some time
