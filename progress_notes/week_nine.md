# Raspberry Pi
- As mentioned at our last meeting, I was successfuly was able to [take a picture and save the file to a directory on the Raspberry Pi](https://youtu.be/PDsRIjVdeC0) using [this tutorial](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-dslr-camera-control/) for controlling DSLRs on Raspberry Pi with [gphoto2](http://www.gphoto.org/)
- This has not been consistent, however, and I tried redoing the installation on a different Raspberry Pi, redoing the installation process on the Raspberry Pi I used previously, etc., so there's some troubleshooting we need to do there


# Experimenting w/ Arduino to control foot pedal
- Followed up with David Rieder and he suggested to instead consider creating a more simple circuit using buttons with the Raspberry Pi-- we can always use the pedal as a container for the buttons later on
